          I'm a web developer specializing in{" "}
          <strong>
            JavaScript, TypeScript, and full-stack web development{" "}
          </strong>
          , with a strong passion for building scalable, real-world
          applications. I’m currently deepening my expertise in modern
          frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>, while working hands-on with
          technologies such as{" "}
          <strong>React, Express.js, MongoDB, Prisma, and PostgreSQL</strong>.
          Over time, I’ve developed a solid understanding of both frontend and
          backend systems, using tools like
          <strong> Zustand, Redux, Appwrite, and Tailwind CSS </strong>to
          deliver responsive, high-quality solutions. I’m committed to writing
          clean, maintainable code and approaching every project with a
          problem-solving mindset. Outside of just coding, I care about building
          products that genuinely make a difference, staying up-to-date with new
          tech, and collaborating with teams that push me to grow.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am pursuing <strong>internship opportunities </strong> to
          gain additional practical experience and collaborate with other
          like-minded engineers.
